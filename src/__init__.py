"""
Routines for working with triangles.
The two modules inside of this package are packed with useful features
for the programmer who needs to support triangles:

``datasets``
    This module provides objects to handle all PLANS datasets.
 
``other``
    For the programmer in a hurry, this module offers quick functions
    that take as arguments the three side lengths of a triangle, and
    perform a quick computation without the programmer having to make
    the extra step of creating an object.
